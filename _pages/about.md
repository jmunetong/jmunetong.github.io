I am a graduate student at Stanford University pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics and Engineering. My research interest lie on Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Numerical Linear Algebra, Stochastic Processes, Generative Models, and Transformers. This past summer I have the fortunate to intern at Adobe Research under Nikos Vlassis. My work focused on developing sub-quadratic attention mechanisms for transformers.
